# Title: ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Date: 2023-09-13

## Status: Accepted

## Context

The purpose of this ADR is to document the decision to use a microservices architecture for "The Road Warrior" system.

## Decision

The decision to use a microservices architecture was made after careful consideration of the following factors:

The system is expected to be deployed in the cloud, and a microservices architecture will make it easier to scale the system to meet demand.
The system is expected to be large and complex (Handling 2 million users in parallel), and a microservices architecture will allow us to break it down into smaller, more manageable components.
The system is expected to evolve over time, and a microservices architecture will make it easier to add new features and functionality.

## Consequences

The consequences of using a microservices architecture include:

* The system will be more complex to design and implement.
* The system will require more monitoring and management.
* The system will be more difficult to test and debug.

## Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies will be used to address the challenges of using a microservices architecture:

* We will use a well-defined microservices architecture framework to guide the design and implementation of the system.
* We will use a service mesh to manage communication between microservices.
* We will use a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment and testing of microservices.

## Next Steps

The next steps are to:

Complete the design of the microservices architecture.
Implement the microservices architecture.
Deploy the microservices architecture to the cloud.
