# Title: ADR-003: UI Technology
## Date: 2023-09-14
## Status: Accepted

## Context
We need to choose a UI technology that is compatible with Android, iOS, and web. This will allow us to develop a unified user experience across all platforms.

## Decision
We have decided to choose React Native as our UI technology. React Native is a JavaScript framework that allows us to develop native mobile apps using React. This makes it easy to develop cross-platform apps that look and feel native on each platform.

## Consequences
The main consequence of choosing React Native is that 
* Need to learn a new framework. 
* React Native apps may not be as performant as native apps that are developed using native languages such as Swift or Kotlin.
  However, React Native apps have come a long way in terms of performance, and they are now comparable to native apps in many cases.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the risk of performance issues, we will use a number of techniques, such as:
* React Native is a popular framework with a large community, so there are plenty of resources available to help us learn.
* Using a caching strategy to store frequently accessed data in memory.
* Using a lightweight JavaScript engine such as Hermes.
* Optimizing our React Native code for performance.

## Next steps
* Set up a development environment for React Native.
* Learn the basics of React Native.
* Start developing our cross-platform app.
* We will also need to monitor the performance of our React Native app and make adjustments as needed.
