# Test Pyramid

## Objective

A test pyramid is a visualization of the different levels and types of tests in a software testing strategy, arranged in the shape of a pyramid to represent the distribution and priorities of these tests. Here's a test pyramid for The Road Warrior:

### Unit Tests

* Scope:
  Unit tests will focus on testing individual components or functions of the application in isolation. These are the smallest and fastest tests.
* Purpose:
  To verify the correctness of small code units in isolation.
* Examples:
  Test individual functions responsible for trip data retrieval, metrics calculation, Email scraping or other specific functionalities. For instance, a unit test for validating that the flight reservation data retrieval function works correctly.

### Integration Tests

* Scope:  
  Integration tests ensure that different components of the dashboard work together as expected. They test the interactions between various modules or services.
* Purpose: 
  To validate that integrated components work together as expected.
* Examples:
  Test the integration of data sources (e.g., flight reservation APIs, hotel booking services) to confirm that data is correctly aggregated. Test how reservation updates made by users on the dashboard propagate to external systems.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

* Scope:
  End-to-end tests validate the entire trip management workflow, including user interactions with the web and mobile interfaces, data aggregation, and integration with external services.
* Purpose: To ensure that the complete application functions correctly from a user's standpoint and that major user flows work as expected.
* Examples:
  Test scenarios like creating a new trip, adding reservations to it, modifying a reservation, and receiving real-time notifications for flight updates. Test both the web and mobile versions of these workflows.


## Additional Considerations

### Load Testing

As the dashboard will handle a significant amount of data and user interactions, we need to consider including load and performance testing to ensure it can handle concurrent users and maintain responsiveness.
