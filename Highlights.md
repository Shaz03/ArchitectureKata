1. Introduction
   - Business Case Overview (Context)
   - Architecture overview of our "The Road Warrior".

2. Systematic architecture and design approach
   - Problem Space
   - Solution Space
   - ADRs
   - Use case illustrations
   - Domain model and System context

3. Architecture
   - Overall Architecture

   - NFR Handling
     - Availability
     - Scalability
     - Performance
     - Usability
     - Extensibility
   - Example:
     - Describe how our architecture handles increased user traffic.
     - Explain the use of load balancers for even distribution of requests.
     - Explain our strategy for data backup and recovery in case of system failures
     - Discuss caching mechanisms and query optimization for improved performance.

4. System Components
   - Our architecture comprises several key components:
     - Back-end components and interactions.
     - External APIs for travel providers.

5. Back-end Architecture
   - Detail about the technology stack for the server-side (i.e. Api gateway and Services).
   - Discuss the use of microservices for scalability, availability and flexibility.
   - Explain the role of the API Gateway in processing user requests.

6. Describe some Key Components
   - Trip Organization
   - Real-time Updates
   - Fetch Reservation details
   - Database (Read-only copy, CQRS).
   - Email Filtering
   - Monitoring and Analytics
   - User Support

7. Testability
